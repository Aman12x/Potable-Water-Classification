# üíß Water Potability Determination

Access to safe drinking water is a fundamental human right, yet **over 2 billion people worldwide** lack access to it.  
Contaminated water can cause severe health issues, including waterborne diseases like cholera, typhoid, and dysentery.  

This project leverages **data science and machine learning** to **predict whether water is safe for human consumption** based on its chemical and physical properties.  
By automating this process, it aims to assist **environmental agencies, researchers, and policymakers** in quickly identifying unsafe water sources ‚Äî helping reduce health risks and improve public health outcomes.

## üìå Project Overview
The project follows a **structured data science pipeline**:
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values using **median imputation** separately for each potability class.  
   - Removing duplicate rows (none found in dataset).  
   - Scaling features using **Min-Max Scaler** for normalization.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution analysis of features.  
   - Correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between variables.  

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Models Used:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Tree Classifier
     - Random Forest Classifier
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Naive Bayes
     - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
     - XGBoost Classifier
     - AdaBoost Classifier
   - Evaluation Metrics:
     - Accuracy
     - Precision
     - Recall
     - F1 Score

4. **Model Comparison**  
   - Performance comparison across models to identify the best-performing algorithm.

## üìå Key Learnings
- **Class-wise imputation** helps retain statistical integrity when data distribution differs between classes.
- **Min-Max Scaling** standardizes feature ranges, improving algorithm performance.
- **Ensemble models** (Random Forest, XGBoost) tend to outperform single estimators for this classification problem.
